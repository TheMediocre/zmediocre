When I need to build things, I usually go for vue Vue.js to code my websites and node-js Node.js with typescript TypeScript for my bots and APIs. My favorite database is definitely postgresql PostgreSQL.

I love discovering languages or frameworks that increase my productivity for my new projects such as Svelte, Golang, Flutter or tools like Sentry so feel free to send me a message with your recommendations on Discord or Twitter! grin
